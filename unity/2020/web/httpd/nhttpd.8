.Sh NAME
.Nm nhttpd
.Nd Nostromo webserver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nhttpd
.Op Fl dhvr46
.Op Fl c Ar configfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a simple, fast and secure HTTP server.  It runs as a single process,
handling connections with
.Xr select 2 .
For CGIs and directory listing it does
.Xr fork 2 .
.Nm
has the minimum of HTTP/1.1 and CGI/1.1 implemented.  Also supported are;
chroot, setuid, basic authentication, SSL, IPv6, custom responses, aliases,
and virtual hosts.  To stop the server send a SIGTERM signal to the PID.
The access log is written in standard CLF format.
.Pp
After changes in the
.Ar configfile ,
.Nm
needs to be restarted, except for changes of the parameters described in
the CONFIGURATION RELOAD section.
.Pp
CGIs are recognized by the file world executable flag.  If it is set, the
file is handled as CGI and will be executed.  Therefore it is possible to
use a CGI as index naming it like defined by the
.Ar docindex
option.  Whether a file or directory is accessible by
.Nm
is decided by its world readable flag.  If it is not set on a file or
directory, it can't be accessed and a 403 Forbidden response will be sent.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Enable debug mode.  More informations about ongoing processes are written to
the
.Xr syslog 3
LOG_DAEMON facility.  Be careful, the logs will grow very quickly in debug
mode.
.It Fl h
Prints short listing of
.Nm
options.
.It Fl v
Prints version.
.It Fl r
.Nm
will
.Xr chroot 2
to
.Ar serverroot .
If you use this option, you have to change
.Ar docroot,
virtual hosts, and aliases in
.Ar configfile
to paths within your
.Ar serverroot .
.It Fl 4
Enable IPv4 and IPv6.
.It Fl 6
Enable IPv6 only.
.It Fl c Ar configfile
Uses
.Ar configfile
as configuration file.  If this option is not set,
.Ar /var/nostromo/conf/nhttpd.conf
will be used by default.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION RELOAD
Parts of the configuration can be reloaded by sending a SIGHUP signal to
the PID.  Those are the following
.Ar configfile
parameters for which configuration reload works:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
logaccess
htaccess
custom_401
custom_403
custom_404
homedirs
homedirs_public
.Pp
.Ed
For changes in the
.Ar configfile
sections ALIASES and VIRTUAL HOSTS no reload is required at all.
All other parameter changes require a full restart of the
.Nm
process to get effective.
.Pp
What also happens during a SIGHUP is that the basic authentication
credentials cache gets cleared.  This can be useful if you have
set a new user password and want to have it effective immediately
instead of giving a user the ability to still login with the old,
cached password.
.Sh SETUID
For security reasons it is recommended to run
.Nm
under an extra user.  To do that create a new user on your system which has a
valid entry in the
.Ar /etc/passwd
file.  Then set the
.Ar user
option in your
.Ar configfile
to that user.  It is necessary to start
.Nm
as root, so it can switch to that user afterwards.  If the
.Ar user
option is not set,
.Nm
will run under the user who started it, except root!
.Pp
Be sure that the permissions on your
.Ar docroot
are set correct, as
.Nm
needs write permissions at least on the logs directory.
.Sh BASIC AUTHENTICATION
To ask for basic authentication on certain directories within your
.Ar docroot
you have to create a file in that directory named like set by the
.Ar htaccess
option in your
.Ar configfile .
The
.Ar htaccess
file should contain one line including the
.Ar realm
option like in this example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
realm Unix Developers Realm
.Ed
.Pp
If the
.Ar realm
option can not be parsed from the
.Ar htaccess
file, it will be set to a default value saying 'unknown realm'.
.Pp
The list of authorized users and their passwords (DES encrypted) are stored
in the file set by the
.Ar htpasswd
option in
.Ar configfile .
To create a new user entry in this file, use the
.Ar crypt
tool.
.Pp
On BSD systems it is also possible to use the BSD authentication framework.
To do that, set the
.Ar +bsdauth
keyword in the
.Ar htpasswd
option instead of a filename.  You are then able to authenticate via your
operating system users.  Be aware that
.Ar +bsdauth
requires a SSL connection to work, because you normally don't want to send
your operating system password unencrypted over the network.  If this condition
is not met, the caller receives a 403 Forbidden response directly.  You can
allow none SSL connections to do BSD authentication by setting the
.Ar +bsdauthnossl
option.  Be sure that you really want that!
.Pp
.Sy Note :
BSD authentication works just on OpenBSD for now.
.Pp
All subdirectories below the
.Ar htaccess
file are protected automatically. The client will be prompted for basic
authentication if accessing such a protected directory.
.Sh SSL
.Nm
uses the OpenSSL library, so be sure you have it installed on your
system if you want to use SSL.  To activate SSL uncomment
.Ar sslport
which is the port where we will listen for SSL connections,
.Ar sslcert
which is the certificate file, and
.Ar sslcertkey
which is the certificate key file. If the certificate and the key are correct
.Nm
will startup with a log entry for SSL activation in the log, otherwise
it will complain and the startup is aborted.  After a successful startup we
are able to handle secure HTTPS connections.
.Sh CUSTOM RESPONSES
If an error response occurs the server will normally send a default answer
saying for example 404 Not Found.  Instead of this default response, you can
define your personal responses, using the custom response options in the
.Ar configfile .
There you define an html file which will be displayed instead of the default
response.
.Pp
The custom response html file will be searched in every defined
.Ar docroot ,
what means in your default
.Ar docroot
and every virtual host.  So you can define different custom responses for each
virtual host.  If a custom response is defined but the corresponding html file
is not found, the default response will be send.  Supported custom responses
are:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
401 Unauthorized
403 Forbidden
404 Not Found
.Ed
.Sh ALIASES
With aliases you can create a fake path which will point to a real path.
For example, to let all links starting with /icons point to another path,
just add the following line in your
.Ar configfile :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/icons /var/nostromo/icons
.Ed
.Sh VIRTUAL HOSTS
To serve virtual hosts, just add a line for each virtual host in
.Ar configfile
with the domain name as option and port if not 80, and the
.Ar docroot
of that virtual host, as in this example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
www.rahel.ch     /var/nostromo/htdocs/www.rahel.ch
www.nazgul.ch:81 /var/nostromo/htdocs/www.nazgul.ch
.Ed
.Pp
For each virtual host a separate access_log is written automatically with
the following syntax as example:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
access_log-www.rahel.ch
access_log_www.nazgul.ch:81
.Ed
.Sh HOMEDIRS
To serve the home directories of your users via HTTP, enable the
.Ar homedirs
option by defining the path in where the home directories are stored, normally
/home.  To access a users home directory enter a ~ in the URL followed by
the home directory name like in this example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
http://www.nazgul.ch/~hacki/
.Ed
.Pp
The content of the home directory is handled exactly the same way as a
directory in your document root.  If some users don't want that their home
directory can be accessed via HTTP, they shall remove the world readable flag
on their home directory and a caller will receive a 403 Forbidden response.
Also, if basic authentication is enabled, a user can create an .htaccess file
in his home directory and a caller will need to authenticate.
.Pp
You can restrict the access within the home directories to a single sub
directory by defining it via the
.Ar homedirs_public
option.
